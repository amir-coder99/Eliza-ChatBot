# 🤖 Eliza-ChatBot, Rule-Based ChatBot (Python)

A simple yet smart *rule-based chatbot* built using Python's if-elif-else logic.  
This chatbot can greet users, respond to basic questions, and even hold a small conversation — all without advanced NLP libraries.  

---

## 📌 Features
- ✨ *Rule-based logic* using if-elif-else
- 💬 Handles greetings, farewells, and simple questions
- 🎲 *Randomized responses* for variety
- 🔍 Keyword matching for flexible input handling
- 😄 Friendly personality with emojis
- 🛠 Runs entirely in the terminal — no extra setup needed

---

## 🖥️ How It Works
The chatbot uses:
- *Input/Output loop* to keep the conversation going
- *Keyword detection* to understand user intent
- *Random choice* for more human-like replies

Example:
```plaintext
You: hello
ChatBot: Hi! Ready to chat?

You: what's your name?
ChatBot: I’m ChatBot, your friendly virtual assistant.

You: bye
ChatBot: Goodbye! Have an awesome day! 🌟
```
